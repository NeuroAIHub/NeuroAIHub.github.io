    <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
    <p>
        NeuroAIHub is dedicated to advancing the frontiers of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
        Our research focuses on developing computational models inspired by the human brain,
        creating efficient neural architectures, and understanding the principles of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
        We work at the intersection of multiple disciplines including computational neuroscience,
        deep learning, cognitive science, and robotics. Our team collaborates closely with
        researchers worldwide to push the boundaries of what's possible in AI research.
